# iOS App Release Metadata

This folder contains release metadata for the iOS application. It follows the standard Fastlane directory structure used by Deliver for managing App Store Connect submissions.

> **Note:**
> As of 2025-07-01, we are not yet using Fastlane to publish iOS app updates. However, we maintain the release notes in this format for bookkeeping and historical reference.
