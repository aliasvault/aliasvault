# Browser Extensions Release Metadata

This folder contains release metadata specifically for the browser extensions.

> **Note:**
> The `fastlane` directory structure does not officially support browser extensions. However, since we already manage the release notes and app information for our iOS and Android apps here, keeping the browser extension release notes in the same location provides a unified overview.
>
> These notes are stored primarily for bookkeeping and historical reference.
