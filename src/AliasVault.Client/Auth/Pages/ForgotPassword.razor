        Unfortunately, if you've lost your password, there's no way to recover it. AliasVault employs end-to-end encryption for all your data, ensuring that nobody except you, can access your data.

    <p>
        If you don't remember your password, you will need to create a new account. Please note that this will result in the loss of all your data.

        If you've recently changed your password and are experiencing difficulties signing in with your new password, please note that the server administrator may be able to recover an earlier backup of your vault to assist you.
        If this is the case, please contact the server administrator.
