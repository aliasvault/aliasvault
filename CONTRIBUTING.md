## Contributing to the documentation
The docs are built using Jekyll and automatically deploy to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions. You can build the docs locally by running `docker compose up` in in the `./docs` folder.

The docs site is based on the open-source template called Just The Docs. Find more information about how this template works in the [official docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/).


To make changes to the AliasVault documentation please make a PR that directly edits the `docs` markdown files in this repository.
