  Backup rules for Android API < 31 (Android 11 and below).
  Excludes sensitive credential identity data from device backups.

  The credential_identities file stores user metadata (usernames, email addresses, service names)
  that should not leave the device, matching iOS ASCredentialIdentityStore behavior which
  explicitly excludes its data from device backups.

  Security rationale:
  - Contains sensitive user information (though no passwords)
  - Should remain device-local for privacy
  - Can be re-synced from vault on new device
