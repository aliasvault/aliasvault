  Data extraction rules for Android API 31+ (Android 12 and above).
  Excludes sensitive credential identity data from cloud backups and device transfers.

  The credential_identities file stores user metadata (usernames, email addresses, service names)
  that should not leave the device, matching iOS ASCredentialIdentityStore behavior which
  explicitly excludes its data from device backups.

  Security rationale:
  - Contains sensitive user information (though no passwords)
  - Should remain device-local for privacy
  - Can be re-synced from vault on new device
