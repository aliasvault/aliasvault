# ⚠️ Auto-Generated Files

This folder contains the output of the shared `identity-generator` module from the `/shared` directory in the AliasVault project.

**Do not edit any of these files manually.**

To make changes:
1. Update the source files in `packages/identity-generator/src`
2. Run the `build-and-distribute.sh` script at the root of the project to regenerate the outputs and copy them here.
