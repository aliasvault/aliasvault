#### Story 1.1: MeshJS Midnight Starter Integration

**As a** developer  
**I want** a working Midnight contract development environment in the monorepo  
**So that** I can build and test the blockchain components

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] MeshJS template cloned to `packages/blockchain/` *(DEVIATION: Used official midnightntwrk/example-counter v2.0.2)*
- [x] Compact compiler (v0.27+) configured *(Compact CLI 0.4.0, language >= 0.20)*
- [x] `pnpm build` succeeds for blockchain package
- [x] Sample contract compiles without errors

---

#### Story 1.2: Wallet Connection (Lace only)

**As a** user  
**I want** to connect my Cardano wallet (Lace/Nami)  
**So that** I can authenticate without a username/password

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] ~~Wallet selection modal shows available wallets~~ *(DESCOPED: Single Lace button — Nami doesn't support Midnight)*
- [x] User can connect Lace wallet
- [x] ~~User can connect Nami wallet~~ *(DESCOPED: Nami has no Midnight support)*
- [x] Wallet address is displayed after connection
- [x] Connection persists across browser sessions

> **Shared Component:** This wallet connection logic is reused by Story 3.3 (Guardian Portal) and Story 5.2 (Alias Generation UI).

---

#### Story 1.3: Wallet Signature Challenge

**As a** user  
**I want** to sign a challenge with my wallet  
**So that** I can prove ownership of my Identity and unlock my vault

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] System generates unique challenge message
- [x] Wallet prompts user to sign message *(signData with connection-proof fallback)*
- [x] ~~Signature is verified client-side~~ *(DEFERRED: Lace signData API not fully stable; authMethod field tracks verification level)*
- [x] Failed signature shows error message
- [x] Successful signature proceeds to unlock flow *(sets isVerified=true; full vault unlock in Epic 2)*

---

#### Story 1.4: VaultRegistry Contract Stub

**As a** developer  
**I want** to deploy a basic VaultRegistry contract  
**So that** I can start registering vault owners on-chain

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] VaultRegistry.compact contract scaffolded
- [x] `registerVault(walletAddress)` function implemented
- [x] Contract deploys to Midnight testnet *(deployed to local network)*
- [x] Registration transaction succeeds

- [x] If unavailable: Hide link gracefully
- [x] Link opens correct address on explorer

---

#### Story 1.6: Remove SRP Auth Flow

**As a** developer

**So that** the codebase relies purely on wallet authentication

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] **DELETE:** All SRP-related code in `WebApiService.ts`
- [x] **DELETE:** SRP encryption helpers in `EncryptionUtility.ts` *(SrpUtility.ts deleted — 151 lines)*
- [x] **DELETE:** SRP data models
- [x] New `WalletService.ts` created to handle auth state

---

### Epic 2: Midnight Smart Contracts & Vault Storage ✅ APPROVED

**User Outcome:** Users' encrypted vaults are stored on IPFS with the CID managed in Midnight private state. Vault saves and retrievals work through the blockchain instead of the .NET server.

#### What's NEW (must build)

| Item | Evidence | Scope |
|------|----------|-------|
| **VaultRegistry.compact** | AR5, Architecture section 4 | Contract with private state for CID, public state for owner/timestamp |
| **Witness function `getVaultCID()`** | AR8 | Wallet-signed retrieval of private CID |

| Vault save flow | `WebApiService.ts` → POST to .NET | New `VaultSyncService.ts` → IPFS + Midnight |
| Vault load flow | GET from .NET → `SqliteClient.initializeFromBase64()` | Midnight witness → IPFS fetch → SQLite |

**FRs Covered:** FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8
**ARs Covered:** AR5, AR8, AR9, AR10, AR11

---

#### Story 2.1: VaultRegistry Smart Contract

**As a** user  
**I want** a smart contract that securely stores my vault's IPFS CID in private state  
**So that** only I can access my data location

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Contract tracks `owner` (public) and `vaultCidHash` (public) — **Deviation:** CID hash (SHA-256, Bytes<32>) stored on public ledger, not full CID in private state. Full CID stored at application layer (too large for Bytes<32>). ADR-006.
- [x] `updateVault(newCidHash)` function (only owner can call) — **Deviation:** Takes CID hash (Bytes<32>), not raw CID string. Owner auth via `persistentCommit` pattern.
- [x] CID retrieval via app-layer `getVaultCID()` API — **Deviation:** NOT a witness function. Full CID stored in TypeScript Map, not Midnight private state. Private state holds only `secretKey` for owner auth.
- [x] `assertCIDv1` logic enforces CIDv1 format — canonical location: `contract/src/cid-utils.ts`
- [x] Unit tests for ownership access control — 16/16 tests including non-owner rejection via circuitContext injection

---

#### Story 2.2: IPFS Service (Pinata)

**As a** developer  
**I want** an IPFS service that uploads encrypted blobs to Pinata  
**So that** vault data is reliably stored and retrieval strings are generated

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] `IpfsService.ts` created with Pinata SDK (`pinata` v1.10.1, unified SDK)
- [x] Feature: Upload `Uint8Array` → returns CIDv1 string
- [x] Feature: Download CID → returns `Uint8Array`
- [x] Error handling for network failures — `withRetry()` exponential backoff (3 retries, 1s base)
- [x] Validation: Returned CID must be CIDv1 — `assertCIDv1` from `@aliasvault/contract`
- [x] Provider abstraction: `IpfsProvider` interface enables swapping Pinata for any pinning service

---

#### Story 2.3: Vault Sync Logic (Save Flow)

**As a** user  
**I want** my vault encrypted and uploaded when I save  
**So that** my credentials are backed up on the blockchain network

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] `SqliteClient.exportToBase64()` (existing) used to get blob
- [x] `EncryptionUtility.symmetricEncrypt()` (existing) used to encrypt blob
- [x] Upload encrypted blob to IPFS — via `PinataBrowserProvider` (browser-compatible REST API) + shared `VaultSyncService` (ADR-003)
- [x] Call `VaultRegistry.updateVault(cidHash)` on-chain — **Deviation:** sends SHA-256 hash of CID (Bytes<32>), not raw CID string
- [x] UI shows "Encrypting vault..." → "Syncing to blockchain..." → "Synced" status progression

---

#### Story 2.4: Vault Sync Logic (Load Flow)

**As a** user  
**I want** to fetch my latest vault when I open the app  
**So that** I see my up-to-date credentials across devices

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Call `VaultRegistry.getVaultCID()` (Story 2.1)
- [ ] Download blob from IPFS (Story 2.2)
- [ ] Decrypt blob with local key
- [ ] Import into SQLite via `SqliteClient.initializeFromBase64()` (existing)
- [ ] Handle "No vault found" case (new user)

---

#### Story 2.5: Contract Deployment Scripts

**As a** dev  
**I want** scripts to deploy contracts to Testnet  
**So that** CI/CD can automate updates

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `deploy.ts` script in `packages/blockchain/cli`
- [ ] Script outputs contract address to `shared/config/contracts.ts`
- [ ] Instructions in README for running deployment

---

#### Story 2.6: VaultRegistry Contract Full Specification

**As a** developer  
**I want** a consolidated specification for all VaultRegistry functions  
**So that** implementations across epics are consistent

**VaultRegistry.compact Functions:**
- `registerVault(walletAddress)` - Epic 1.4
- `updateVault(cid)` - Epic 2.1
- `getVaultCID()` witness - Epic 2.1
- `storeRecoveryKeyHash(keyHash)` - Epic 3.2 _(ADR-007: stores SHA-256(shamirSecret) for verification; actual key is ephemeral)_
- ~~`getRecoveryKey()` witness~~ _(ADR-007: removed — recovery key derived from Shamir shares during recovery)_
- `transferOwnership(newWallet)` - Epic 3.5
- `addBackupWallets(wallets[])` - Epic 3.6
- `initiateBackupTransfer()` - Epic 3.6
- `getPublicKey(wallet)` witness - Epic 5.5
- `notifyNewMail(owner, emailCID)` - Epic 5.6

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] All functions documented in contract header — 80-line spec header + VAULT-REGISTRY-SPEC.md canonical doc
- [x] Access control matrix defined (owner-only vs public vs witness) — in contract header + SPEC.md
- [x] State variables: owner (public), vaultCID (private), recoveryKey (private), backupWallets (private), emailCIDs (private)
  - **Deviation (Story 2.6):** `recoveryKeyHash` and `backupWallets` are on the **public ledger**, not private state. Compact has no `private state {}` block — all private state is TypeScript-only (ADR-006). Only the *hash* of the recovery key is stored on-chain; the actual key is ephemeral — derived from Shamir shares during recovery (ADR-007, Pattern 6 v2). `emailCIDs` deferred to Epic 5.
- [x] Unit tests for each function — 33 VR tests (1 skipped due to simulator block-time limitation)

> **Note:** This story consolidates contract work from Epics 1-5. Implement incrementally per epic.

### Epic 3: Recovery & Breach Defense ✅ APPROVED

**User Outcome:** Users can recover from password loss via trusted guardians, AND defend against wallet compromise by transferring ownership to a backup wallet. Both are MVP-critical security features.

---

#### Story 3.2: Shamir Secret Splitting (Pattern 6 v2)

**As a** user setting up guardians
**I want** to encrypt my Master Password with an ephemeral key derived from a Shamir secret, then split that secret into shares
**So that** no single guardian can access my password and recovery works cross-device

**So that** I can recover my Master Password on any device

**Acceptance Criteria (ADR-007 — Pattern 6 v2):**
- [ ] UI monitors `GuardianRecovery` for approval events
- [ ] Once 2+ shares approved and 72h time-lock expired: Fetch IPFS package (contains encrypted password + encrypted shares)
- [ ] Decrypt 2+ shares with guardian private keys
- [ ] Recombine shares using Shamir combine → Get `shamirSecret`
- [ ] Verify `SHA-256(hex(shamirSecret))` matches on-chain `recoveryKeyHash` (integrity check)
- [ ] Derive encryption key: `SHA-256("aliasvault:rk:" + hex(shamirSecret))`

**So that** I can recover if I lose my primary wallet

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] UI to add backup wallet addresses (up to 3)
- [ ] Store backup addresses in `VaultRegistry` private state
- [ ] Backup wallet can call `initiateBackupTransfer()` (starts 72h timer)
- [ ] Owner alerted immediately on backup transfer attempt

---

### Epic 4: Credential Management ✅ APPROVED

**User Outcome:** Users can manually add/edit credentials with proper conflict resolution when syncing across devices.

#### What's NEW (must build)

| Item | Evidence | Scope |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Credential add/edit via IPFS** | FR9 | SQLite → Encrypt → IPFS → Update Midnight CID |
| **Credential-level merge** | AR12 | Compare credential IDs, not entire vault blobs |
| **Last-write-wins for same credential** | AR12 | Timestamp comparison for identical credential edits |
| **Client-side conflict detection** | AR13 | Detect CID changed before saving |

#### What EXISTS (reuse)

| Item | Evidence | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| `SqliteClient` CRUD | Lines 204-1610 | ✅ All credential operations |
| `EncryptionUtility.symmetricEncrypt()` | Line 49 | ✅ Vault encryption |

**FRs Covered:** FR9
**ARs Covered:** AR12, AR13

---

#### Story 4.1: Credential Add/Edit Flow

**As a** user  
**I want** to add or edit credentials in my vault  
**So that** my login information is securely stored

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] UI form: service name, username, password, alias email, notes
- [ ] Generate `credentialId = hash(service + username + timestamp)` (Architecture line 341)
- [ ] Store `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps
- [ ] On save: `SqliteClient.execute()` → `EncryptionUtility.symmetricEncrypt()` → `IpfsService.upload()` → `VaultRegistry.updateVault(cid)`
- [ ] Success/error feedback in UI

**Source:** Architecture Section 3, lines 340-348

---

#### Story 4.2: Credential-Level Merge

**As a** user syncing from multiple devices  
**I want** credential-level merge  
**So that** I don't lose changes from other devices

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Implement `resolveVaultConflict(localVault, remoteVault)` (Architecture line 351)
- [ ] New credentials on remote: add to local
- [ ] Same credential modified: last-write-wins via `updatedAt` comparison
- [ ] Deletion conflicts: remote modification wins (user can delete again)
- [ ] Edge case: simultaneous new credential with same service+username creates two entries (ID includes timestamp)

**Source:** Architecture Section 3, lines 351-385, 395-396

---

#### Story 4.3: Conflict Detection & UX

**As a** user saving my vault  
**I want** to detect if the CID changed since I last loaded  
**So that** I don't overwrite changes from another device

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Before save: fetch current CID from `VaultRegistry.getVaultCID()`
- [ ] Compare with local `lastKnownCID`
- [ ] If different: auto-merge using Story 4.2 logic
- [ ] Show notification: "Changes merged: Added X credentials, updated Y credentials" (Architecture line 391)
- [ ] User reviews merged vault before final upload
- [ ] Option to force overwrite (advanced)

**Source:** Architecture Section 3, lines 389-392

**Dependencies:** Story 2.3 (Save Flow provides the base sync logic)

### Epic 5: Alias Email System ✅ APPROVED

**User Outcome:** Users can generate anonymous email aliases (@alias.id), receive emails via SMTP, and manage their alias identities.

---

> [!NOTE]
> **Conflict Resolved (2026-01-11)**
> 
> **Decision:** Proceed with **Mox SMTP + Express TypeScript bridge** as originally proposed.
> 
> **Rationale:** Midnight SDK is TypeScript-only. The existing C# SmtpServer cannot integrate with Midnight contracts without significant workarounds.
> 
> **Full Decision Record:** [ADR-001: SMTP Infrastructure](file:///docs/architecture/adr-001-smtp-infrastructure.md)

---

**FRs Covered:** FR20, FR21, FR22, FR23, FR24
**ARs Covered:** AR7, AR19, AR20

- [ ] `claimAlias(localPart: String, domain: String)` registers alias to caller's wallet
- [ ] `getOwner(localPart: String, domain: String)` returns owner wallet (public) or null
- [ ] `releaseAlias(localPart: String, domain: String)` removes ownership (owner only)
- [ ] Anti-squatting: claim requires 1 NIGHT fee (transferred to protocol wallet)
- [ ] Alias names validated: 3-64 chars, alphanumeric + hyphen, no leading/trailing hyphen
- [ ] Unit tests for all contract functions
- [ ] Integration test: claim → getOwner → release flow

**Technical Notes:**
- Use private state for alias-to-owner mapping (privacy)
- Witness function for ownership queries

**Dependencies:** Epic 2 (VaultRegistry must exist for public key lookup)

#### Story 5.2: Alias Generation UI

**As a** user  
**I want** to generate a new email alias from my browser extension  
**So that** I can sign up for services without revealing my real email

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] "Generate Alias" button visible on extension popup
- [ ] Custom alias name input with real-time validation
- [ ] Auto-generate random alias option (e.g., `zk-tiger-7842@alias.id`)
- [ ] Display NIGHT fee before confirmation
- [ ] Wallet signature required to claim alias on-chain
- [ ] Success: show new alias, copy-to-clipboard button
- [ ] Error: display if alias already claimed

**Technical Notes:**
- Call `AliasRegistry.claimAlias()` via Midnight SDK
- Store alias locally in SQLite for quick lookup

**Dependencies:** Story 5.1 (AliasRegistry contract)

---

#### Story 5.3: SMTP Bridge Service

**As a** system  
**I want** to receive email webhooks and verify alias ownership  
**So that** only legitimate emails reach vault owners

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Express TypeScript service at `smtp-bridge/`
- [ ] `POST /receive-email` webhook endpoint
- [ ] Extract alias from `to` header
- [ ] Query `AliasRegistry.getOwner()` via Midnight SDK
- [ ] Return 404 if alias not registered
- [ ] Return 200 with encrypted email CID on success
- [ ] Rate limiting: max 100 emails/minute per alias
- [ ] Email size limit: 5MB max
- [ ] Health check endpoint: `GET /health`
- [ ] Prometheus metrics: emails received, errors, latency

**Technical Notes:**
- Use `@midnight-ntwrk/client-sdk` for RPC calls
- Cache public keys (TTL: 5 minutes) to reduce RPC calls
- See architecture section 5 for implementation reference

**Dependencies:** Story 5.1 (AliasRegistry contract)

---

#### Story 5.4: Mox SMTP Server Deployment

**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** Mox configured to forward emails to the bridge  
**So that** `@alias.id` emails are processed by our system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Mox Docker container deployed
- [ ] `domains.conf` configured with IncomingWebhook to bridge
- [ ] SMTP ports 25 and 587 exposed
- [ ] TLS certificate configured (Let's Encrypt via ACME)
- [ ] SPF/DKIM/DMARC records documented
- [ ] MX record for `alias.id` domain points to Mox server
- [ ] Test: send email to `test@alias.id`, verify webhook received

**Technical Notes:**
```yaml
Accounts:
  aliasvault:
    IncomingWebhook:
      URL: http://smtp-bridge:3000/receive-email
      Authorization: Bearer ${BRIDGE_SECRET}
```

**Dependencies:** Story 5.3 (Bridge must exist to receive webhooks)

---

#### Story 5.5: Email Encryption & IPFS Storage

**As a** system  
**I want** to encrypt emails before storing them  
**So that** only the alias owner can read their mail

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Fetch owner's public key from `VaultRegistry.getPublicKey()`
- [ ] Encrypt email JSON with AES-256-GCM (random symmetric key)
- [ ] Encrypt symmetric key with owner's public key (RSA-OAEP)
- [ ] Package: `[encryptedKey][iv][authTag][encryptedBody]`
- [ ] Upload encrypted blob to Pinata IPFS
- [ ] Return CIDv1 (validate with `assertCIDv1()`)
- [ ] Handle attachments: include in JSON, encrypt together
- [ ] Max email size after encryption: 10MB

**Technical Notes:**
- Reuse encryption patterns from `shared/logic/`
- See architecture section 5 "Encryption Strategy"

**Dependencies:** Story 5.3 (Bridge calls this after ownership verification)

---

#### Story 5.6: Email Notification via Contract

**As a** user  
**I want** to be notified when I receive email  
**So that** I know to check my vault

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `VaultRegistry.notifyNewMail(owner, emailCID)` function added
- [ ] Emits public event: `{ event: 'NewMail', owner: hash(wallet), timestamp }`
- [ ] CID stored in private state (owner can retrieve via witness)
- [ ] Contract-sponsored transaction (protocol pays gas)
- [ ] Extension polls for new mail events (every 60 seconds when active)
- [ ] Badge notification on extension icon when new mail

**Technical Notes:**
- Bridge calls this after IPFS upload succeeds
- Use `sponsored: true` in transaction submission

**Dependencies:** Story 5.5 (Email must be on IPFS first)

---

#### Story 5.7: Email Viewing in Vault

**As a** user  
**I want** to read my encrypted emails in the vault  
**So that** I can see messages sent to my aliases

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] "Inbox" tab in vault UI
- [ ] List view: shows from, subject, date (decrypted)
- [ ] Fetch email CIDs from `VaultRegistry` (witness function)
- [ ] Download encrypted blob from IPFS
- [ ] Decrypt using vault's private key
- [ ] Display email body (HTML sanitized, text fallback)
- [ ] Display attachments with download option
- [ ] Mark as read (local state)
- [ ] Delete email (unpin from IPFS, remove CID from contract)

**Technical Notes:**
- Decryption happens client-side only
- Use existing `EncryptionUtility` patterns

**Dependencies:** Story 5.6 (Emails must be stored and notified)

---

#### Story 5.8: Alias Management UI

**As a** user  
**I want** to manage my aliases  
**So that** I can view, organize, and delete them

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] "Aliases" tab in vault settings
- [ ] List all owned aliases with creation date
- [ ] Show which credential/service uses each alias
- [ ] "Release Alias" button (returns alias to available pool)
- [ ] Confirmation dialog before release ("This cannot be undone")
- [ ] Released alias: emails sent to it will bounce
- [ ] Copy alias to clipboard
- [ ] Search/filter aliases

**Technical Notes:**
- Call `AliasRegistry.releaseAlias()` for deletion
- Local SQLite cache for fast listing

**Dependencies:** Story 5.2 (Aliases must be claimable first)
