## Self-hosting
For full control over your own data you can self-host and install AliasVault on your own servers.

### Install using install script

This method uses pre-built Docker images and works on minimal hardware specifications:

- Linux VM with root access (Ubuntu/AlmaLinux recommended) or Raspberry Pi
- 1 vCPU
- 1GB RAM
- 16GB disk space
- Docker installed

```bash
# Download install script from latest stable release
curl -L -o install.sh https://github.com/lanedirt/AliasVault/releases/latest/download/install.sh

# Make install script executable and run it. This will create the .env file, pull the Docker images, and start the AliasVault containers.
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh install
```

The install script will output the URL where the app is available. By default this is:
- Client: https://localhost
- Admin portal: https://localhost/admin

> Note: If you want to change the default AliasVault ports you can do so in the `.env` file.

## Security Architecture
<a href="https://docs.aliasvault.net/architecture"><img alt="AliasVault Security Architecture Diagram" src="docs/assets/diagrams/security-architecture/aliasvault-security-architecture-thumb.jpg" width="343"></a>

AliasVault takes security seriously and implements various measures to protect your data:

- All sensitive user data is encrypted end-to-end using industry-standard encryption algorithms. This includes the complete vault contents and all received emails.
- Your master password never leaves your device.
- Zero-knowledge architecture ensures the server never has access to your unencrypted data

For detailed information about our encryption implementation and security architecture, see the following documents:
- [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
- [Security Architecture Diagram](https://docs.aliasvault.net/architecture)
