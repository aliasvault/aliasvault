Installing the extension from the Chrome Web Store is the easiest way to get started. This ensures that you are always using the latest version of the extension.

2. Click on the "Add to Chrome" button
3. The extension will be installed and added to your browser

## Build from Source
If you wish to install the extension from source instead, see the [build-from-source](build-from-source.md) documentation. This will allow you to make changes to the extension and/or to use a specific version of the extension.
