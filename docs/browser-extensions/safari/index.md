# Safari Extension
In order to install the Safari Extension, see the options below.

## Download from MacOS App Store
Installing the extension from the MacOS App Store is the easiest way to get started. This ensures that you are always using the latest version of the extension.

1. Go to the [MacOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6743163173) page
2. Click on the "Get" button
3. The extension will be installed and added to Safari. Follow the instructions in the AliasVault MacOS app that is shown on screen after installation.

## Build from Source
If you wish to install the extension from source instead, see the [build-from-source](build-from-source.md) documentation. This will allow you to make changes to the extension and/or to use a specific version of the extension.
