## What is AliasVault?

AliasVault is a self-hosted password and (email) alias manager that helps you:

- 🔐 **Secure Passwords** - Store and manage passwords with zero-knowledge encryption
- 📧 **Email Aliases** - Generate unique email addresses for each service
- 🎭 **Identity Management** - Create and manage separate online identities
- 🏠 **Self-Hosted** - Run on your own infrastructure using Docker
- 🔓 **Open Source** - Transparent, auditable, and free to use

## Key Features

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture
All data is end-to-end encrypted on the client. Your master password never leaves your device, and the server never has access to your data.

### Built-in Email Server
Generate virtual email addresses for each identity. Emails sent to these addresses are instantly visible in the AliasVault app.

### Virtual Identities
Create separate identities for different purposes, each with its own email aliases and credentials.
