# Updating from < v0.10.0
{: .no_toc }

This guide covers the upgrade process from version < v0.10.0 to the latest version. Due to significant database changes, this upgrade must be performed in two steps:

1. First upgrade to version 0.17.0 and perform the database migration
2. Then upgrade to version 0.18.0 or greater

Since the v0.10.0 release the database backend has changed from SQLite to PostgreSQL. This change is required because SQLite is not suitable for environments with concurrent writes that AliasVault requires.

A built-in database migration tool is included in the installer script to help you migrate your data from SQLite to PostgreSQL.

## Update Steps

1. First, backup your existing SQLite database:
```bash
cp database/AliasServerDb.sqlite database/AliasServerDb.sqlite.backup
```

2. Update AliasVault to version 0.17.0:
```bash
./install.sh install 0.17.0
```

3. Run the database migration tool:
```bash
./install.sh migrate-db
```

4. After the migration has completed successfully, restart all AliasVault containers:
```bash
./install.sh restart
```

5. Test the upgrade by logging in to the admin panel and checking that your data is intact.

6. Once you've confirmed everything is working correctly, you can update to the latest version:
```bash
./install.sh update
```

If you encounter any issues during the upgrade, please create an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lanedirt/AliasVault/issues) or contact via Discord.
